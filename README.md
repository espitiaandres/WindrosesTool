## Python Windrose Tool

This tool generates monthly, seasonal, or unsectioned Windrose plots and/or polar plots. Unsectioned Windrose plots display all the chosen data in 1 output graph.

Data is entered through the command line, and different parameters are set to format how resulting plots look.

Next steps:

- Refactoring code to make it more scalable, using OOP and MVC patterns and designs.
- Make a webtool that allows the user to select from a given database and from multiple types of polar and rose plot types.
