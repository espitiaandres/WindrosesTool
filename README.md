## Python Windrose Tool

As of July 27, 2020, this tool generates monthly, seasonal, or unsectioned Windrose plots or polar plots.

Data is entered through the command line, and different parameters are set to format how resulting plots look.

Next steps:
-Refactoring code to make it more scalable, using OOP and MVC patterns and designs.
-Make a webtol that allows the usre to select from the database and from multiple types of polar and rose plot types.
